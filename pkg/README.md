# pkg Directory

[🇯🇵 **日本語**](./README_JA.md)

This directory contains library code that can be safely imported by external applications. Code placed here should be well-designed, stable, and intended for public use.

**Guidelines:**
- Place reusable packages that other projects can import
- Ensure APIs are well-documented and stable
- Avoid internal implementation details
- Follow Go package naming conventions

For more details on Go project layout and package organization, see the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) and [project layout standards](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout#pkg).
